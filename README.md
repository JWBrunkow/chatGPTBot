# chatGPTBot
## A Python Discord bot which integrates chatGPT functionality into a Discord slash command

This requires an **openAI account** and a **discord server with developer mode** enabled. 



To use this code after cloning this repo, create an  ````.env```` file, and add the following to the file:

```` 
DISCORD_TOKEN = (add your token from the discord developer portal here)
CHATGPT_API_KEY = (add your key from the chatGPT, generated from beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)
````

after this is installed, run the ```` run.py ```` file

# chatGPTBot
A Python Discord bot which integrates chatGPT functionality into a Discord slash command

THIS WILL NOT WORK UNLESS A ````.env```` FILE IS ADDED TO A CLONED VERSION OF THE REPO WITH A DISCORD API KEY AND A CHATGPT API KEY

This file should contain only the following:

```` DISCORD_TOKEN = (add your token from the discord developer portal here)
CHATGPT_API_KEY = (add your key from the chatGPT, generated from beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)````
